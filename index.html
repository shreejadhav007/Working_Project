            <hr />
            <p>
              <strong>This is some additional information here. <br /></strong>
              Maharashtra is one among the five states that register the highest
              combined risk of ischemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes in
              2016, which has significantly increased since 1990. As per the
              data of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS 4), only 56.2
              percent of children is fully immunized in 2015-16, which is a drop
              of more than 2 percent since the previous survey. Besides, 37.4
              percent married women do not use family planning methods, up from
              35.1 percent during the previous survey and trends show dismal
              uptake of any method other than female sterilization, such as
              intra-uterine devices (1.6 per cent), contraceptive pills (2.4 per
              cent) and condoms (7.1 percent). The state is also struggling to
              stock adequate medical abortion (MA) pills. An independent study
              finds that only 1.2 per cent chemists in Maharashtra — three of
              the 252 reviewed in five cities – have stocks as the rest chose
              not to citing legal hassles. Founder of Medicus, Bhavesh Shahsays,
              “In the hinterlands of India, it is not rare to come across people
              who have travelled hundreds of kilometers and faced considerable
              difficulty to get a medicine as basic as a painkiller or
              anti-allergic. Last year, the Maharashtra Association of Resident
              Doctors (MARD) complained of shortage of medicines in hospitals of
              Nagpur, Satara, Miraj, and Nanded. The Comptroller and Auditor
              General of India (CAG) too noted that at least 24 states are short
              of essential drugs. We are about to complete a year of Ayushman
              Bharat scheme and the shortage of medicines and lack of continuous
              medical education (CME) of doctors can cause serious damage to
              this well-intended scheme. This app is a novel concept and we
              expect it to play a significant role in closing the gap between
              the unmet needs of the people and availability of health services
              as well as medicines. About one-third of the deaths that take
              place in India are preventable and happen only because health
              services in smaller cities and villages are far from optimum.
              However, everyone has a smartphone these days. Medicus tries to
              utilize this deep penetration of digital technologies for the
              benefit of people by connecting doctors, medicine manufacturers
              and suppliers, social sector organizations, medical association
              and the government.”

            <h2>Drug Shortage: Causes, Impact, and Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <p>This is an example blockquote in action:</p>

            <p>
              Drug shortage is a global issue affecting low, middle, and
              high-income countries. Many countries have developed various
              strategies to overcome the problem, while the problem is
              accelerating, affecting the whole world. All types of drugs, such
              as essential life-saving drugs, oncology medicines, antimicrobial
              drugs, analgesics, opioids, cardiovascular drugs,
              radiopharmaceutical, and parenteral products, are liable to the
              shortage.

            <p>
              The causes of drug shortages are multifactorial. For example,
              manufacturing problems, financial pressures, shortage of raw
              materials, and just in time inventory are found as essential
              causes of medicine shortages in developed countries of the EU,
              United States, Saudi Arabia, and developing countries like
              Pakistan, Fiji

              A medicine donation can save lives and ease suffering when well coordinated and
managed. In cases where recipient countries are not able to ensure adequate access to
medicines, donations can bring major benefits to persons in need.

           <li> <p>
              Medicine donations can become a strategic benefit for the recipient country. Medicine
              donations are often used to support the rebuilding of health systems, or to ensure
              access of populations to health products they otherwise would not have.

            <p>
              SERUDS Old Age Home is almost a decade and a half old. Still, we
              face tough times when it comes to providing medicines and regular
              hospital visits. A total of 20 elderly women stays in Seruds Old
              Age Homes, out of which 9 have critical health issues. With mostly
              on medication (promptly required) and occasional checkup is direly
              needed. Nevertheless, we never found an issue with that because
              there are nice people who make a charity of medicines. Though
              people like you donate, still the needs aren’t met. We try our
              best to take care of them like our own parents or grandparents. We
              request everyone to make donations for medicines and other medical
              requirements so that the world for the golden ager can be a better
              place.

              This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been
              written to fill the available space and show how a longer snippet
              of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to
              keep the demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this
              exact same string of text.
